This evening I have a mixed feeling. Anxious, tired but extremely wanting to know more about **Gulp**. Similar with Dante and Travis Neilson, I've tasted the hell of **Gulp**. For a couple of hours I've been wonderin' what the hell did I do with my life and my precious spare time. *SIGH*

I've been rescued by **Bat**man (pun-intended). Tweaking script below has lifted me from Inferno into Paradiso, and I am craving for more. This night I'll tweak my gulp file again. 

{% highlight js %}
/**
 * Build the Jekyll Site
 * DO NOT CHANGE spawn into exec
 * CHANGE jekyll into jekyll.bat (IMPORTANT!)
 */
gulp.task('jekyll-build', function (done) {
    browserSync.notify(messages.jekyllBuild);
    return cp.spawn('jekyll.bat', ['build'], {stdio: 'inherit'})
        .on('close', done);
});

{% endhighlight %}
